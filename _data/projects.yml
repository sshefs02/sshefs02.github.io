    Comparison of Multi-Layer Feed Forward Neural Network with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks to approximate highly non-linear functions.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    In the financial sector, the sales price forecasting is a hot issue. Since the indices associated with the stock are nonlinear and are affected by various internal and external factors, they are very difficult to model and pose a difficult problem to be solved by the researchers. This project is devoted to designing an intelligent prediction model based on the radial basis function network (RBFN). To tune its parameters a learning algorithm is developed using the back-propagation (BP) method. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with that of the multi-layered feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN) containing only a single hidden layer and the results obtained from the simulation study indicate that the performance of RBFN is better as compared to the MLFFNN model.
