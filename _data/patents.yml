  description: "Schema Mapping is the process of mapping different schema standards to smoothly transform data from one format to another. Every organization requires data to be in a consistent format for use. Data Consistency demands incoming data to be mapped before on-boarding onto any platform. Given tons of data in the software industry, manual mapping is a tedious task. There is a need for Auto Mapping. Automatic Schema mapping in itself is a challenging problem to solve owing to format specific conversions. We propose a novel clustering based deep learning model BERTMap which maps input data to target schema fields. Clustering on schema fields is defined on semantic data types which eliminates frequent retraining of a model when new target schema fields are provided. Via clustering, seamless integration of hierarchical schemas is achievable. The model enables seamless integration of hierarchical schemas via clustering based on semantic data types, eliminating the need for frequent retraining. BERTMap achieves an F1 score of 0.97 showing superiority to state of the art semantic data-type detection models for the task of schema mapping."
